<div class="section">
Forms in the CPF are represented as an ordered list of form elements.
Each form element has at least a name (used to fetch its information
later), and a type (used to describe its appearance and validation
rules). In addition, each element can have extra information to
help control the element's appearance or behaviour, usually dependent
on the type.

<p/>

This ordered list of elements is represented as a PHP array:

<pre class=screen>
require 'form.h';

$form = array(
	'first_name' => array ( 'type' => 'text' ),
	'age'        => array ( 'type' => 'integer' ),
	'city'       => array ( 'type' => 'text' ),
	'email'      => array ( 'type' => 'email' )
);
form_set($form);
</pre>


Extra attributes can be indicated by extending the array. For
instance, we'll make the city field default to something, and require
the email address be present and the age be positive:

<pre class=screen>
require 'form.h';

$form = array(
	'first_name' => array ( 'type' => 'text' ),
	'age'        => array ( 'type' => 'integer', 
				'positive' => 1),
	'city'       => array ( 'type' => 'text',
				'default' => 'Toronto' ),
	'email'      => array ( 'type' => 'email', 
				'required' => 1 )
);
form_set($form);
</pre>

<p>Go ahead, <a href="examples/formdetails.2a.html">play with that form now</a>.
<p/>

This form descriptor can be shrunk, without changing its meaning.
If you just have a type, provide a string with that type name. If
you have a type field along with some constraint (like age or
required) set to 1, tack it on with a comma. Like so:

<pre class=screen>
/* functionally identical to the form descriptor immediately above */
require 'form.h';

$form = array(
        'first_name' => 'text',
	'age'        => 'integer,positive', 
	'city'       => array ( 'type' => 'text',
				'default' => 'Toronto' ),
	'email'      => 'text,required'
);
form_set($form);
</pre>

Forms can be automatically rendered by the CPF.
In this case, the element name is used to automatically make up a
field label, using a simple algorithm for capitalization and
introducing spaces. In the above example, the automatically-generated
field labels will be "First name", "Age", "City", and "Email". These
automatic names can be overridden with the pretty attribute (see
below).

<p/>
A full description of the form language is in <a href="form.h.html#set">the documentation for form_set()</a>.


<h3>Controlling the appearance of your forms</h3>

When rendering a form, the CPF does a straightforward arrangement
in a table, in the order that the form elements were declared. If
this isn't enough for you, you can control the form layout yourself
directly in the page.

<p/>
In our earlier example,
the form was rendered with

<pre class=screen>
&lt;? form_start();
   form_end(); ?>
</pre>


<p/>

Imagine form_start() as a replacement for HTML's &lt;form>, and form_end as replacement for &lt;/form>. To lay out the form yourself, just use your own markup between the two:

<pre class=screen>
/* file.data */
require 'form.h';
$form = array(
        'name'       => 'text,required',
        'age'        => 'integer',
        'biography'  => 'bigtext',
);
form_set($form);


/* file.html */
&lt;? form_start(); ?>
Enter your name: &#64;@name&#64;@

&lt;p/>Enter your age: &#64;@age&#64;@.

&lt;p/>Enter your biography:&lt;br/>
&#64;@biography&#64;@.

&lt;p/>Then click here: &#64;@submit&#64;@
&lt;? form_end(); ?>
</pre>


<p/>

<a href="examples/formdetails.2.html">As you can see</a>, the form engine takes your form variable names between pairs of @@ signs, and substitutes the HTML entities that correspond to your form widget declarations.

<p/>

Now, what happens if you add a new form widget, but no corresponding layout for it?

<pre class=screen>
form_set(array(...
        favourite_colour => array(
                'type'=>'text',
                'menu'=>array('r'=>'Red','b'=>'Blue')
	)	
);
</pre>



The answer is <a href="examples/formdetails.3.html">this: the new form element is rendered anyway</a>.  
<p/>

The form engine recognized the new favourite_colour widget wasn't drawn, 
and so tacked it on to the end of the form. 
It's hideous, but
maybe that's a good way to get you to properly lay it out. It
forces you to keep your form definitions and page layout
in sync.
