<p>This book is the documentation for the Content Publishing
Framework, a system for rapid web development with PHP and
PostgreSQL. The CPF was created by Tiny Planet Consulting, who have
made it available to the world under the GNU GPL, and offer paid
support and customizations for the framework, as well as for
numerous other open-source projects.</p>
<p>The CPF offers a straightforward templating system, effective
database connectivity, and explicit support for concurrent
development under CVS.</p>
<p>This manual offers both tutorial and reference material, and
should be viewed as the definitive source for information on what
the CPF can do.</p>
<p>The most recent version of this software is available <a href=
"http://tinyplanet.ca/cpf" target="_top">on the Web</a>.</p>
