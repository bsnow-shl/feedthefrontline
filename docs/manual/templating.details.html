<h3>Request handling process</h3>
This section will outline in complete detail which pages and parts of pages are executed while serving a request with the CPF. Imagine the following directory structure:

<pre class=screen>
site/docs/_template.html

site/docs/foo/_directory.data
site/docs/foo/page.data
site/docs/foo/page.html

site/conf/config.h
site/conf/globals.h
</pre>

and imagine that a browser has requested <cite>/foo/page.html</cite>.


<ol>

<li>
<cite>conf/config.h</cite> is loaded first. This should provide
global configuration for your site. Module-specific configuration
goes in here - site name, email address of maintainer, preferred
country for geographic pull-downs, etc. This file is mandatory.

<li>

<cite>conf/globals.h</cite> is loaded next. If you need functions or any other
libraries that should be available to every page on your site,
include them here. This file is optional.


<li>

<cite>foo/_directory.data</cite> is run in the directory where the part is
located. This performs a similar role as .htaccess in Apache: you
can place directory-wide access controls (see Chapter 6), define
directory-scoped functions or variables, and so on. This file is
optional.


<li>

<cite>foo/page.data</cite> is run. This file is optional.


<li>

The first half of <cite>_template.html</cite>, the part before
"##PART##", is run. This file is mandatory.


<li>

<cite>foo/page.html</cite> is run. This file is, of course, mandatory.


<li>

The second half of <cite>_template.html</cite>, the part after
"##PART##", is run.

</ol>


<h3>Keyword subtitutions</h3>

Keywords in the part are first identified by looking at the part's <em>preamble</em>. The preamble is the first HTML comment in the part, denoted with <cite>&lt;!--</cite> and <cite>--></cite> pairs.

<p>
<pre class=screen>&lt;!--
&lt;title>    &lt;em>Respect&lt;/em> the title   &lt;/title>
&lt;colour>   green                              &lt;/colour>
-->

... remainder of part follows
</pre>

This preamble defines two keywords, named <b>title</b> and <b>colour</b>.  These keywords can be substituted into the part, using magic tokens surrounded by &#64;@ pairs, &#64;@likethis@&#64;.

<p/>The case of the keyword between the &#64;@ pairs 
influcences how keyword substitution is done.
If the token is lowercase, the keyword is substituted verbatim.
If the token is uppercase, the keyword is substituted with HTML tags removed.


Consider the following example:
<pre class=screen>
/* _template.html */
&lt;html>&lt;body>

&lt;pre>
title yields: &#64;@title@@
TITLE yields: &#64;@TITLE@@
colour yields: &#64;@colour@@
&lt;/pre>

##PART##

&lt;/body>&lt;/html>



/* index.html */
&lt;!--
&lt;title>    &lt;em>Respect&lt;/em> the title   &lt;/title>
&lt;colour>   green                        &lt;/colour>
-->

... remainder of part follows
</pre>

<a href="examples/templating.1/">This is the result.</a>
As you can see, @&#64;TITLE@&#64; has been substituted without tags.
