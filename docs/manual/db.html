<div class="section">

If we can learn anything from the last few decades of dealing with
relational databases, it's that SQL is an incredibly leaky abstraction. In
spite of the presence of standards written by very smart people, it
is not widely known what is, and what is not, "standard" SQL. Worse,
widespread support for SQL97 is only appearing in 2003, with SQL99
still some ways off. MySQL is still working on adding sub-selects,
and everybody thinks it's the best thing since sliced bread.

<p/>

Most database vendors don't bother to tell you which parts of the
standards they support, because if you accidentally start using a feature
only they support, you're locked in to their system, and the cost of
switching has just gone up dramatically. Good for them, bad for you.

<p/> In the face of all this, writing a database abstraction layer seems
a ludicrous concept. Why pretend you're using some abstract SQL engine
(you're not sure which one) when sooner or later, you'll be writing SQL
statements that bind you fully and firmly to some particular SQL system.
It's just not worth pretending.

<p/>That said, the CPF does not prohibit using PEAR or any of the other
dozen or so database abstraction layers, should you wish to use them.

<br/>
<br/>

<p/> It doesn't take much experience with the web and databases to
realize that queries fall into five categories:

<ol>
<li>
      give me a value

<li>
      give me a row

<li>
      give me a list of values

<li>
      give me a list of rows

<li>
      everything else
</ol>

Therefore, the CPF explicitly supports each of these five possibilities with five function calls, each returning

<ol>
<li>
      a scalar (<a href="db.h.html#value">db_value</a>)

<li>
      a hash (<a href="db.h.html#row">db_row</a>)

<li>
      an array of scalars (<a href="db.h.html#array">db_array</a>)
<li>

      an array of hashes (<a href="db.h.html#multirow">db_multirow</a>)

<li>
      a PostgreSQL result object (<a href="db.h.html#send">db_send</a>)
</ol>



<h3>Some database layer examples</h3>

Here is an example that uses the hundreds of thousands of lines of code in your database and web servers to add two numbers together:

<pre class=screen>
   $answer = db_value('select 5+7');
   print $answer;
</pre> 

The first thing to notice is that there is no connection management
infrastructure to deal with: all you do is ask for an answer, and in the
background the CPF will take care of finding your database, connecting
to it, sending the query, fetching the query, iterating over the query
rows, and dealing with any exceptions that may crop up during any of
these steps.

<p/>
The above code is an example of the first kind of database call we
identified in the previous section: fetch one value, done via the db_value
function. Here are some more examples that deal in a single value:

<pre class=screen>
   print db_value('select email_address from users where user_id=?', 52);
   print db_value('select count(*) from users');
   print db_value("select avg(income) from population where married='y'");
</pre> 

Note that they all return exactly one row with exactly one column. The
name of the row isn't important. The first example makes use of a modern
database-ism called placeholders. More on that in shortly. For now,
though, it's enough to know that the question mark in the query is
replaced with the user ID given, and that this is an insanely useful
feature.

<p/>
The second type of call is one where you want fetch an entire row's worth
of data, whether from one table, by joining several tables together,
or anything else you can imagine that will return a single row of
information. This is done with the <cite>db_row</code> call.

<pre class=screen>
  $row = db_row("select name,address,phone_number from users 
                 where user_id=?", 52);
  print "User 52's name is ".$row['name'];
</pre> 

In this case, the CPF fetches an entire row, and turns it into a hash,
keyed by the name of the column. More examples:

<pre class=screen>
  db_row('SELECT users.last_name, demographics.number_of_children
             FROM users,demographics
            WHERE users.user_id = demographics.user_id 
              AND users.user_id = ?', 52);
  db_row('SELECT MAX(age) as maxage, MAX(income) as maxincome 
            FROM demographics'); 
</pre> 

<p/> In the first example, the rows will be returned as a hash with
two keys: "last_name" and "number_of_children".

<p/> In the second example, the aggregate column names (and thus the
has keys) are explicitly given a name, with SQL's AS phrase. This is
a good habit to get into, so that you can be certain what the hash key
for that information will be.

<h3>The incredible gift of placeholders</h3>

These alone are worth the price of admission.

<p/>
All of the CPF's database calls that take SQL also take any number of
SQL parameters, terming them <em>placeholders</em>.  

Placeholders are a common sight in database abstraction systems
outside of PHP. They have a number of performance benefits, but their
primary benefit is in producing more secure, reliable code for the
programmer. Consider an online banking system that permits visitors to
change their address. Perhaps you might write code like the following:

<pre class=screen>
db_send("update addresses set postal_code='$postcode' where customer_id=$id");
</pre>

<cite>$postcode</code> came from a form the user filled out. Seems
reasonable. Now imagine if the user enters their new postal code like
so: <cite>' blah; update accounts set balance='10000000</code>. Now,
the following SQL was sent to the database: (slightly cleaned up for
legibility)

<pre class=screen>
update addresses set postal_code='' blah;
update accounts set balance='10000000' where user_id=92
</pre>

The first query will fail, and the second query will make our attacker a millionaire. Whoops. One alternative is to use placeholders:

<pre class=screen>
db_send('update address set postal_code=? where customer_id=?', $postcode, $id);
</pre>

The database layer will intelligently substitute each parameter in
place of the question marks, performing any necessary quoting on the
parameter value to protect against bad information being sent to the
database. This also supports the PHP language's value null as a a means
of setting an SQL NULL.

<pre class=screen>
/* sets all last_visit columns to SQL NULL */
$value = null;
db_send('update log set last_visit=?', $value);
</pre>

Queries must provide at least parameter for every placeholder. If you
provide extra parameters beyond those required, they will be ignored. If
you don't provide enough, a PHP error message will be raised.

<p/> The system is also smart enough to distinguish between quoted
question marks (that are left alone) and unquoted question marks:

<pre class=screen>
/* won't confuse the database layer */
db_send("update users set favourite_character='?' where user_id=?", $user_id);
</pre>
