<p>Form handling is possibly one of the most annoying and least
interesting aspects of web development. Even the simplest of form
systems should let the user see which fields are required, and
which are not, and should point out mistakes without requiring data
re-entry, by applying validation rules both canned and custom. And
of course the system has look out for the ', ", and &gt; symbols
that inevitably mess things up.</p>
<p>Form handling systems vary wildly in their approach to these
problems. Some take an extremely abstract approach, treating each
form element as an object, and permitting the form's author to
override the object and provide custom validation functions, or
custom functions for appearance, error messages, and so on. This
sounds like a lot of work.</p>
<p>In contrast, the CPF's form handling system's goal is to support
quickly bashing out a form, by declaring its characteristics, and
leaving the specific appearance and behaviour issues for later.
Here is a form description for a form with three elements (name,
address, and age). Take a look at <a href=
"http://tinyplanet.ca/cpf/examples/1.html" target="_top">the
result</a>.</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
form_set(array(
        'name' =&gt; 'text,required',
        'address' =&gt; 'text,required',
        'age' =&gt; 'integer,positive'
));
</pre>
<p>This form will also politely deal with missing information,
negative or invalid numbers, and re-displaying the form in case
there's mistakes. You get all that for free.</p>
<p>The Content Publishing Framework lets you quickly bash out a
form and get it on the screen. Later, you can apply some
refinements - a better layout, more detailed validation, etc.</p>
<p>You might recall that when you're hand-coding HTML, you have to
indicate with the &lt;form action=&gt; attribute which URL the form
should be sent to. That is not the case with the CPF. The idiom we
use is that web pages with forms on them send the information to
themselves, verify the information, and if it's good, issue an HTTP
redirect to the next step or confirmation page. This approach
provides a lot of flexibility for a number of things, as we shall
see.</p>
<div class="SECTION">
<h1 class="SECTION"><a name="AEN590" id="AEN590">5.1. A detailed
example</a></h1>
<p>You saw in <a href="templating.html">Chapter 3</a>&gt; that
pages are actually split in two: the template and the part. The
part is itself split into information (a .data extension), and an
HTML fragment that lays it out (a .php or .html file). In the forms
facility, you specify form content and rules in the .data file, and
you may choose to lay out the form in the .php file, or just let
the system generate a reasonable-looking layout for you.</p>
<p>Here is a detailed example of a form that collects a name, age,
and biography from the user. The name is required, the age must be
positive, and the biography can be left empty.</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
/* form.data */
require_once 'form.h';

form_set(array(
        'name' =&gt; 'text,required',
        'your_age' =&gt; 'integer,positive',
        'your_biography' =&gt; 'bigtext'
));
if (form_valid()) {
        print "Nice to see you, $name";
}
</pre>
<pre class="SCREEN">
/* form.php */
&lt;!--
&lt;title&gt;Form example&lt;/title&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;? form_start();
   form_end(); ?&gt;
</pre>
<p><a href="http://tinyplanet.ca/cpf/examples/2.html" target=
"_top">This is what you'll see when you load up form.php.</a></p>
<p>As you can see, it infers form labels from the abstract names
you gave. It intelligently deals with underscores (turning them
into spaces) and generally looks alright. Try out the live example,
and submit some information.</p>
<p>Now let's imagine that a lawyer knocks on your door, and says
that you can't collect information about children who are younger
than 15. That's a one-line change:</p>
<pre class="SCREEN">
        age =&gt; array('type'=&gt;'integer', 'min'=&gt;16),
</pre>
<p><a href="http://tinyplanet.ca/cpf/examples/3.html" target=
"_top">This is what you get now.</a></p>
<p>Each of those types -- text, integer, bigtext -- are termed
<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">widgets</i></span>, a
term used in desktop application development that refers to
graphical elements that do something or collect information.
Although they have some relation to the usual range of form
elements, they are not necessarily one-to-one. In the form
descriptor, you simply describe the information you want to
collect, and leave how it is collected to the framework.</p>
<p>This pays off when the user agents improve. Right now, some web
browsers support some kind of styled-text editing field, supporting
various colours and font choices. Most webmail systems use this
facility. It's an excellent replacement for the baleful empty stare
of a TEXTAREA element. When you ask the CPF for a form element of
type <kbd class="USERINPUT">bigtext</kbd>, it intelligently figures
out if the remote browser can support rich text editing, and if so,
uses that.</p>
<p>Eventually, more interesting widgets will be possible: little
calendars for entering dates, or calculators to help you figure out
dollar figures. Most of this is possible with Flash MX or
incredible feats of Javascript hacking. Eventually, the web will be
nearly as usable and responsive as a desktop computer circa
1987.</p>
