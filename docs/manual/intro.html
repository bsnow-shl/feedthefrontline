<div class="section">
 The Content Publishing Framework is a low-ceremony, highly-effective system for quickly developing and publishing web sites using PHP and 
 PostgreSQL. It features a simple templating system, elegant form handling, a useful database model, and facilities for user management and 
 role-based permissions. It's mostly 
 modular and designed to be easy to extend, merge in future improvements, and support concurrent development using CVS.  
         
<p/>
 The framework's driving value is effectiveness. There's no idealism here in any form: no object-oriented nirvana, no squandered effort on 
 database abstraction, and it does not attempt to be all things to all people. It's meant for people who have to quickly develop and operate 
 a dynamic web site, and don't mind using a system with some opinions about how things should be done.   
         
<p/>
 Some of the consequences of this philosophy include a complete lack of support for MySQL, or any other database aside from PostgreSQL. The system has been 
 integrated with other codebases that themselves use MySQL, but the core depends loosely but irretrievably on PostgreSQL.  
         
<p/>
 Its original author is Stephen van Egmond, who wrote the system based on his experience with complex, large-scale web development, and the 
 practical, small details that can make it easy for those involved. Support is provided through Tiny Planet Consulting, a consulting company 
 that builds standards-based infrastructure, and advises on software development process and technique. Other developers, notably Bill Snow, 
 have contributed to its development.       
         
<h3>Software requirements</h3>
         
 This system requires recent versions of Apache, PHP, and PostgreSQL to work. Apache 1.3.26, PHP 4.3, and PostgreSQL 7.4 have been seen to 
 work well. The PHP modules mhash and pgsql are required.
         
<p/>
 <em>Optional and recommended packages.</em> The page testing infrastructure requires Ant 1.5 and a Java 1.4 development environment. 
 <ul>
 <li> CVS 1.10 or some other source control system.
 <li>exim mail server
 <li>ecartis mailing list manager
 <li>xdebug PHP extension 
 <li><a href="http://www.reedmedia.net/software/virtualmail-pop3d/">vm-pop3d POP3 server</a> supporting virtual maildrops
 </ul>
         
<p/>
 As of May 2003, if you are running the Debian "Woody" distribution, running the following command as root will load the appropriate 
 packages into your system:        
         
<p/>
<pre class=screen># recommended installation on Debian
apt-get install postgresql apache php4-pgsql php4-mhash \ 
  php4 cvs ant alien memcached
pear install xdebug
pear install memcache </pre>
<p/>

 You will still have to go to <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun's web site</a> to download the Java 1.4 development RPM -- not the runtime. Once downloaded, you can turn the 
 RPM into a Debian package with alien: 
 <pre class="code">
alien j2sdk*.rpm
dpkg -i j2sdk*.deb     </pre>         
<p/>

<h4>Configuring PHP</h4>
<pre class=screen>
# recommended /etc/php4/apache/php.ini

auto_prepend_file =  prepend.h
auto_append_file =  append.h
error_reporting = 2039
asp_tags = on 

register_globals=off
magic_quotes_gpc=off
zlib.output_compression = on

default_charset = "utf-8"

extension=pgsql.so
extension=mhash.so
extension=xdebug.so

xdebug.auto_trace=on
xdebug.collect_params=off
xdebug.show_mem_delta=on
xdebug.trace_output_dir=/tmp </pre>


<h4>Configuring PostgreSQL</h4>

 PostgreSQL must be configured with <cite>transform_null_equals=true</code> in <code>/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf</code>.  

<pre class=screen>
sudo su - postgres

createlang plpgsql template1

createuser www-data
# can create databases? yes
# can create new users? no 

createuser youraccount
# can create databases? yes
# can create new users? no 
</pre>
         
<h4>Configuring exim</h4>

<pre class=screen>
# /etc/exim/exim.conf

...
# permit the web server to forge mail senders
trusted_users = www-data
</pre>


If you want Exim to work with vm-pop3d:

<pre class=screen>
# /etc/exim/exim.conf

...

# transports section
# how to deliver to a virtual mailbox
virtual_localdelivery: 
	driver = appendfile 
	file = /var/mail/virtual/${domain}/${local_part} 
	user = mail 
	group = mail 
	mode = 660
end


# directors section
# people who match this director are delivered to a virtual mailbox
virtual_localuser: 
	driver = aliasfile 
	file_transport = address_file 
	transport = virtual_localdelivery 
	domains = "partial-lsearch;/etc/exim/domain.map" 
	file = /etc/exim/${domain_data}/passwd 
	modemask = 000
	search_type = lsearch 

# people who match this director go through a virtual alias
virtual_alias: 
	driver = aliasfile 
	file_transport = address_file 
	pipe_transport = address_pipe
	domains = "partial-lsearch;/etc/exim/domain.map" 
	file = /etc/exim/${domain_data}/aliases 
	modemask = 000
	search_type = lsearch* 
	user = mail 
	qualify_preserve_domain 
</pre>

<h2>Recommended reading</h2>

   This manual assumes that you are at least somewhat familiar with PHP, SQL, and the fundamentals of HTML and web programming. Here are some suggested
   materials if you don't know them.

<dl>
<dt>
   PHP
   <dd>
          The <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/">PHP manual</a> is an excellent place to learn PHP. Run through the tutorial, read the language reference, paying less attention to the later
          sections on references and objects, then skim the chapters on "Variable functions", "Array functions", and "String functions".

<dt>
   SQL
   <dd>
          Philip Greenspun's <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/">SQL for Web Nerds</a> is a good place to get a crash course in SQL. Try to tune out the parts where it talks about Oracle. The
          <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/">PostgreSQL manual</a> is an excellent place to understand Postgres's own unique take on SQL.

<p/>
          For truly advanced SQL, SQL for Smarties by Joe Celko is an excellent resource that will teach you all the things you didn't know you didn't
          know about SQL.

<dt>
   HTML and CSS
   <dd>
          The <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/">Web Design Group</a> publishes outstanding references to <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/>wHTML 4.0</a> and <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/">CSS</a>. They quickly explain the relevant points for each and every tag in
          the specifications. If you don't already know CSS, you can learn it in fairly short order using their tutorial.

<dt>Web publishing
<dd>
	<a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/">Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing</a> is, as the author now says, sort of embarrassing for all
	its retro emphasis on <em>usable</em> sites built out of <em>boring</em> technology, but if you really lack
	for opinions why the Web can be cool, and how it can be made that way, the author will hand you
	quite a few to choose from.
	<p/>
	His <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/internet-application-workbook/">Internet Application Workbook</a> 
	is somewhat drier, but has a clearer focus.  Watch for the parts where he disses PHP: I've paid attention, and tried
	to remedy those beefs with the CPF.

<dt>
   Everything else
   <dd>
          In addition to the obvious search engines, three resources stand out among the places to figure out unfamiliar technologies: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.com</a>
          offers crash courses on a number of technologies. <a href="http://www.whatis.com/">Whatis.com</a> is a great way to quickly learn about an acronym and get pointers to places to
          learn about them. Finally, the <a href="http://www.wdvl.com/">Web Developer Virtual Library</a> takes a more comprehensive look at standards-based technologies, including HTTP,
          and XSL.
