<p>
The Publishing Framework's templating system is designed to enforce a consistent look and feel across your entire site, or entire subsections of your site. It does this by providing a straightforward templating system that permits a separation between how the site looks overall, and how individual pages behave.

</p>

<h3> Terminology</h3>

You can mentally split up most web pages you see these days into two parts: navigation that changes infrequently (which CPF terms the <em>template</em>), and page-specific material (which CPF terms the <em>part</em>). The template lives in a file called <cite>_template.html</cite>, and the part is whatever file under Apache's document root your web browser is asking for.

<p>


<h3>An example</h3>

A basic CPF template looks something like this:

<pre class=screen>
/* _template.html */
&lt;html>
 &lt;head>
   &lt;title>page title&lt;/title>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
 ##PART##
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

Imagine there's a file called <cite>page.html</cite> that looks like this:

<pre class=screen>
Hello world!
</pre>

Notice that there is no markup whatsoever in this page. It's just one line with two words on it. When a web browser pulls <cite>page.html</cite> through the CPF, this is what the browser will get:

<pre class=screen>
&lt;html>
 &lt;head>
   &lt;title>page title&lt;/title>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
Hello world!
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

The magic token ##PART## in <cite>_template.html</cite> has been replaced with the contents of <cite>page.html</cite>..
<p/>


The part can do more than appear verbatim inside the template: certain elements of the part are extracted and substituted into the template. The most common use is giving your page a title that web browsers can understand, via HTML's &lt;title> tag. Let's change the template like so:

<pre class=screen>
&lt;html>
 &lt;head>
   &lt;title>@&#64;TITLE@@&lt;title>
 &lt;head>
 &lt;body>
##PART##
 &lt;body>
&lt;html>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

And change the part like so:

<pre class=screen>
&lt;--
&lt;title>Greetings&lt;/title>
-->

Hello, world!
&lt;/html>
</pre>

If this page is put through the templating system, the browser gets something like this:

<pre class=screen>
&lt;html>
 &lt;head>
   &lt;title>Greetings&lt;/title>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
Hello, world!
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the title has been extracted from the part, and sucked into the template. Using this technique, you can propagate all kinds of page-specific material up to the template.
</p>

<h3>How to make your graphic designer love you</h3>

<p>

Many templating systems go to some effort to distinguish between
functional behaviour and graphical appearance. This, in principle,
permits a "separation of concerns" between programmers and graphical
designers, who, it is thought, will work on disjoint parts of the
code base. Although perhaps overly idealistic, this is a worthwhile
idea to aim for. At the very least, designers and programmers can
avoid stomping on each other's code and use tools they prefer.

<p/>

The CPF takes a stab at such a separation by splitting parts into
two separate files: the functional behaviour is specified in a file
with a .data extension, and the user-visible HTML is in a file with
a .php or .html extension suitable for use by Dreamweaver.

<p/>
A simple example will illustrate this separation. Imagine you have
a system that has to display the contents of an address book, and
display it in an HTML table, with one entry per table row. We'll
build a data structure that has two address book entries, then
design a page to display them. These will be in two separate files.

<pre class=screen>
/* show-addressbook.data */

// this would usually by fetched with SQL, but we're not there yet
$book = array(
        array('name' => 'Steve',
              'address' => '24 Sussex',
              'phone number' => '416 555 1212'
              ),
        array('name' => 'Juan',
              'address' => '78 Sussex',
              'phone number' => '416 555 1212'
              )
);
</pre>

<pre class=screen>
/* show-addressbook.php */
&lt;-- 
&lt;title>Address book example&lt;/title>
-->

&lt;table>
&lt;tr>
 &lt;th>name&lt;/th>
 &lt;th>address&lt;/th>
 &lt;th>phone number&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;? foreach ($book as $row): ?>
    &lt;tr>
     &lt;td>&lt;%= $row['name'] %>&lt;/td>
    &lt;/tr>
&lt;? endforeach ?>
&lt;/table>
</pre>


 Thus, the <cite>.data</cite> file is an ideal place to hold what I like to call <em>horrible programmer gunk</em>. That includes
 such esthetically unattractive things as database queries, form handling, exception handling, error reporting, page redirects,
and sending out emails.

<p/>

In fact, the .data file is so perfect for this kind of stuff that it is entirely parsed in PHP mode: notice that the <cite>parse-addressbook.data</cite>
 above doesn't have a <cite>&lt;?php</cite> opening tag.
 The .data file should almost never generate output directly aside from HTTP headers. It makes sense to have it prepare things that will be output by the <cite>.php</cite> file, though.
