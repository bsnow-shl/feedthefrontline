<h3>Questions and answers about system translations</h3>

<p>
System translations contain text that is generated by system software and plug-in modules.
These generate user-visible text,
which needs to be translated.
</p>

<p>As a result, you will often see little bits of confusing markup in the original English.
You should very closely follow the formatting and layout of the original English when performing a translation.
</p>

<h3>HTML markup</h3>
<p>
Sometimes you will see HTML markup like &lt;b> and &lt;i> or hyperlinks like <blockquote>Click &lt;a href="file.html">here</a>.</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Reproduce this material <em>exactly</em>, including the HTML markup.  A good way to start is to copy and paste the English, then replace all the English words with the corresponding phrases in the corresponding language.
</p>


<h3>Formatting strings</h3>
<p>
Sometimes you will see formatting strings like <blockquote>Your order number is %s.</blockquote> or <blockquote>%s out of %s points obtained</blockquote>. In these cases the %s are substituted with variables by the
underlying software module.
</p>

<p>When translating this material, your final translation should have as many % markers as in the original text, and they should have the same semantic meaning given their position in the text. For instance, in the above example of "%s out of %s points obtained" (as in, "5 out of 10"), your 
translation should  have the first %s signify the number of points obtained, and have the second %s signify the number that could be obtained.  
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Original text is:
<dd>"You got %s points out of a possible %s." 
<dt>Good translation:
<dd>"Vous avez obtenu %d points du maximum de %d."
<dt>Bad translation:
<dd>"Du maximum de %d points, vous avez obtenu %d".  
<dd>This is bad because it reverses the meaning of the % substitutions.
</p>
