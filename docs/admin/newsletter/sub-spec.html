<div class="section">
<p>
You can subscribe a number of people to mailing lists by providing a batch in a comma-separated file format (CSV). Our format is:
<pre>
   email, first name, last name, company
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Step-by-step</h3>
<p>
First, arrange a spreadsheet that looks like this.
</p><p>
<img src="sub-spec-1.png" />
</p>
<p>
<em>Note</em> that the only strictly required item is <kbd>email</kbd>.   All other columns are optional.
</p>
<p>
Then, export the worksheet with the addresses you want to upload into a comma-separated file (.CSV). This is
often done with the Save As command in typical spreadsheet applications.
</p><p>
<img src="sub-spec-2.png" />
</p>

<p>Start Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac OSx).  Load the .CSV file.
</p><p>
<img src="sub-spec-3.png" />
</p>

<p>Select the entire file and copy it into your temporary buffer (ctrl-A, ctrl-C).
On the <a href="sub.html">subscription form</a>, paste it in (ctrl-V).
</p>

<h5>Obscure situations</h5>

<p>
When you have information with a comma (like a company called <b>Frobozzco, International</b>) most spreadsheets
will quote the information: <tt>"Frobozzco, International"</tt>. This is what we expect.
</p>

<p>If for some reason you have a quotation mark that belongs in the content, most spreadsheets will
double quote the quote and still quote for any commas: <b>"Hello, Kitty," he said</b> becomes <tt>"""Hello, Kitty,"" he said"</tt>.
This is what we expect.
